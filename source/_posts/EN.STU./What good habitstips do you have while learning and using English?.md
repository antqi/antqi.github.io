Nothing o(╥﹏╥)o，Because I think my English is not good.

But, when going to Thailand to play in 2018, most locals speak English with tourists. I can understand and respond simply. This is due to frequent watching American dramas (From 2010 until now).



Awww, please avoid judging yourself. Watching American series is exactly a good habit of learning English. And practice it in a real situation, for example, talking to the local people when traveling abroad is helpful to improve your English as well. ;))

下面是小建议：
when going to Thailand [后面都可以不要] in 2018, most [of the] locals speak [既然是2018年那么这里是不是应该用过去式呢？以及后面也是可以去掉]
I can[要用过去式]...
This is due to frequent watching American dramas (From [大写就不必了] 2010 until now).
